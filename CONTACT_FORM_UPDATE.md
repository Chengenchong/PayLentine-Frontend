# Contact Form Update - Email Only

## Overview
Updated the "Add New Contact" form to only require an email address, simplifying the contact creation process.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Contact Types (`src/types/contacts.ts`)
- Modified `CreateContactRequest` interface to make email required and name optional
- This allows the backend to auto-generate a name from the email if not provided

```typescript
// Before
export interface CreateContactRequest {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  nickname?: string;
}

// After
export interface CreateContactRequest {
  email: string;
  name?: string;
  nickname?: string;
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Contact Service (`src/services/contacts.ts`)
- Updated `createContact` function to auto-generate name from email if not provided
- Uses email prefix (part before @) as default display name

```typescript
// Auto-generate name from email if not provided
const requestData = {
  ...contactData,
  name: contactData.name || contactData.email.split('@')[0],
};
```

### 3. Simplified ContactsDashboard Form (`src/pages/ContactsDashboard/Content.tsx`)

#### State Management
- Simplified `newContact` state to only include email field
- Updated form reset logic

#### Validation
- Added comprehensive email validation using regex pattern
- Enhanced error messages for better user experience

#### UI Changes
- Removed name and nickname fields from the add contact dialog
- Added explanatory text about auto-generated display names
- Added email validation and placeholder text
- Disabled submit button when email field is empty

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users had to fill in 3 fields: Name (required), Email (required), Nickname (optional)
- More complex form with multiple validation requirements

### After
- Users only need to enter an email address
- System automatically generates a display name from the email
- Simpler, faster contact creation process
- Clear instructions about auto-generation

## Features

✅ **Email-only contact creation** - Just enter an email address
✅ **Auto-generated names** - Display name created from email prefix
✅ **Email validation** - Real-time validation with helpful error messages
✅ **Enhanced UX** - Clear instructions and disabled states
✅ **Backward compatibility** - Still supports name field if provided by backend

## Example Usage

1. User clicks "Add Contact"
2. User enters "john.doe@example.com"
3. System creates contact with:
   - Email: "john.doe@example.com"
   - Name: "john.doe" (auto-generated)
   - Display shows: "john.doe (john.doe@example.com)"

## Backend Considerations

The frontend now sends:
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "name": "user"  // auto-generated from email prefix
}
```

This maintains compatibility with backends that require a name field while simplifying the user input process.

## Testing

✅ Build completed successfully
✅ TypeScript compilation passed
✅ All imports and types resolved correctly
✅ Form validation working as expected

The update provides a much simpler contact creation experience while maintaining all necessary functionality and backend compatibility.
